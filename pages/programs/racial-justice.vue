          The Racial Justice Program aims to preserve and
          extend constitutionally guaranteed rights to people
          who have historically been denied their rights on the basis of race.
          We pursue actions to transform our community that
          affirms the value of people of color and the disenfranchised.

          <h1>What</h1>
          <p>
            Human trafficking is the action or practice of illegally transporting people
            from one country or area to another, typically for the purposes of forced labour or commercial
            sexual exploitation.
            It is the third largest international crime industry (behind illegal drugs and arms
            trafficking).

          <h1>How</h1>
          <p>
            Trafficking victims are often lured into another country by false promises.
            All the work is done under the menace of a penalty or the person has not offered himself
            voluntarily and is now unable to leave.

          <h1>Why</h1>
          <p>
            The person is recruited and forced or deceived into conducting
            some form of criminal activity such as pick pocketing, begging, benefit fraud, and
            prostitution.
            Through corecion, a person will experience a serious form of denial of freedom.
